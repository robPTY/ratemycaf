# RateMyCaf - Mobile Web Applications SPR23 Final Project 

# Description
RateMyCaf is a web application/search engine for cafeterias of universities accross the
United States which allows it's users to create an account linked to their university email
and look at reviews of theirs and other school's cafeterias. The menu's and descriptions of each
cafeteria on respective campus are updated on RateMyCaf on the daily. The user can create comments
to give other users credibility for the reviews of each cafeteria and provide a community aspect. Future
implementations consist of adding an events system, allowing users to create a page for their respective
university if not available, and more.
